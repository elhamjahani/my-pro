# my-pro
for resolving a problem, always there is a way.

## Task 1

### Solution 1
in this solution I want to write one line of commands (you can find it in Task1/solution1.sh)
I use 2 command:
1- seq  -> which print a sequence of numbers in my range
2- shuf -> generate random permutations
So I create a range of 1 to 10 and print in random order by shuf command.
for running script you can download script (or copy content in a new file) and run script:
bash> bash solution1.sh
Or add excexution permission to file and run it:
bash> cd SCRIPT_PATH
bash> chmod +x solution1.sh
bash> ./solution1.sh
